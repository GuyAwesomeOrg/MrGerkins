We all despise bugs. So if you are plagued by a bug or defect, do raise it with us. You can do this by creating an issue.

##Contribution Process
The standard way of contributing ideas, features or bug fixes is by raising pull requests (PR).

* Fork our [repository]().
* Make modifications to the develop branch. In case of bug fixes, raise a PR against the master branch.
* Do add unit tests and ensure that test coverage is maintained.
* If the change impacts documentation, kindly update the documentation to keep it relevant.
* Ensure that a commit represents a logical unit of the change you are making. Kindly squash commits that are too small. Ensure that the commit messages are relevant to the changes made.
* Raise a PR once you are done with your changes. For bug fixes the PR should be against master branch. For features raise it against develop branch. Kindly provide a brief description of changes in the description of the PR. In case there is a corresponding issue, please reference it in the PR description.
* We'll review your pull requests and use github to communicate comments. Keep an eye on the PR/associated email for our comments.
* We merge the pull request the review and follow up action itmes are complete, and close the issue.

##Traceability

Generally, it is a good practice to reflect a single issue in a pull request. Multiple issues fixed by a single
pull request will be accepted iff these cannot be separated into  individual pull requests reflecting each issue separately.


Looking forward to your contributions to Mr. Gerkins!s
